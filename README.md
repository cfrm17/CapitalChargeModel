# Capital Charge Model

FRB’s Supervisory Guidance on Market Risk requires that all new models and material model modifications be approved by the FRB prior to implementation for use in the calculation of minimum regulatory capital. Banks are required to establish and maintain a Board-approved definition of materiality to assess modifications to regulatory capital models. The definition of materiality should reflect the Bank’s view of what constitutes a material change, must include quantitative and qualitative factors, and meet FRB’s principles.

FRB requires a bank to notify its primary federal supervisor promptly if it makes any change to an internal model that would result in a material change in the amount of risk-weighted assets for a portfolio of covered positions or when the bank makes any material change to its modeling assumptions. 

The bank's primary federal supervisor may rescind its approval, in whole or in part, of the use of any internal model and determine an appropriate regulatory capital requirement for the covered positions to which the model would apply, if it determines that the model no longer complies with the market risk capital rule or fails to reflect accurately the risks of the bank's covered positions. The bank’s primary federal supervisor may require the bank to revise its model assumptions and resubmit the model specifications for review.

The bank makes any change to an internal model approved by the FRB under the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk that would result in a material change in the bank's risk-weighted asset amount for a portfolio of covered positions.

Minimum Required Regulatory Capital is an expression of the Enterprise's capital requirement relative to FRB’s Capital Requirement for Market Risk.

Regulatory capital model is an approach or model developed by the Bank for the purpose of measuring and quantifying estimates of risk, the output of which is used in the calculation of Minimum Required Risk-Based Capital.

Model Modification is any change to a risk-based Capital Models which trigger the need for model validation outside of the scheduled review frequency. This also includes the development of new risk-based Capital Models, all of which require initial validation by Model Risk and Validation.

All modifications to risk-based capital models/approaches – hereinafter referred to as “model modifications”, regardless of materiality, will be subject to the same internal governance and change management processes and will be tracked and reported.

The materiality definition for model modifications must be approved by the US Model Risk Management Committee (USMRMC). The definition and thresholds must be reviewed at least annually by key stakeholders and the US Model Risk Management Committee. Any changes require approval by USMRMC.

The materiality of all model modifications must be assessed in adherence with the approved definition.

If a model modification is deemed to be material, FRB’s approval process will need to be followed and the model must be approved by FRB prior to being implemented for use to determine risk-based capital.

A full assessment of the materiality of a modification to a non-material model will not be required except where it is grouped with other models as one modification.

Materiality must be assessed for all model modifications using both qualitative and quantitative factors. The materiality assessment must be approved by the Managing Director, Risk Models and concurred with by the Model Risk Management Committee (MRMC).

Individual model modifications should be grouped together for the purposes of determining materiality where the driver/rationale for the change is the same (e.g. all models within a risk rating system are being modified together, a key data source changes that impacts a group of models, etc.). The rationale for aggregating or disaggregating model modifications must be clearly documented. 

Capital is mainly charged for derivatives positions for both credit risk and market risk. Equity derivatives include options, forwards, and swaps, like https://finpricing.com/lib/EqBarrier.html
